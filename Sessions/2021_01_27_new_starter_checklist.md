## Checklist for new starters

* Can you connect to the VPN?
See [this](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/blob/main/Sessions/2020_11_11_eddie.md#vpn) for help.

* Can you get onto Eddie?
See [same doc as above](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/blob/main/Sessions/2020_11_11_eddie.md#connecting-to-eddie) for help. 

Both connecting to the VPN and using Eddie will be different for Mac and Windows users. If you need to ask someone in the group for help see a [list on Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/E1EF1987-6F26-4F52-873C-9622CB4A26E0?tenantId=2e9f06b0-1669-4589-8789-10a06934dc61&fileType=xlsx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fuoe.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FDepressionResearch%2FShared%20Documents%2FCoding%20club%2FOS_everyone_works_on.xlsx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fuoe.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FDepressionResearch&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:c424c64008714e978593e70c6171f95a@thread.tacv2&groupId=2fc34ec6-881a-4474-8731-d36e84b8ec9e) of who can help with your OS.

* Accessing data
Also on the [same doc as above](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/blob/main/Sessions/2020_11_11_eddie.md#storing-data-on-eddie-and-getting-files-tofrom-datastore), this will tell you about our shared drive called `GenScotDepression` you need permission to access this.

* Other departmental resources:
  - [Departmental wiki](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/Psychiatry) is full of useful links and info and is generally a good first port of call.
  - Work in progress: [Github repo](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/ukb) with FAQs for UKB specifically. Instead of Mark/Shen being asked the same question by different people we are begining to collate these FAQs into one doc that everyone can add to.
  - [Coding resources](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/blob/main/Resources.md) from this repo.
