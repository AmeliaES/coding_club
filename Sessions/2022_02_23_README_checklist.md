## Guidelines for READMEs

README's are a text or markdown (.md) file is an overview document with the most important info about your project. Typically used with GitHub it's the file that is displayed when someone views your repository.

See https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/good-enough-practices/04-collaboration/index.html for a lesson and exercise in READMEs.

#### Checklist for README's:
* Project title
* Project description. Perhaps the Abstract for a project you're working on. 
* Contact information. Especially important if you leave the department.
* Broad overview of the folder structure and a brief description of what is in each folder. Including a README in subdirectories can be useful too.
* Any requirements/software that should be installed for your scripts to run. Links/instructions on how to install said software is useful too.
* How to access data you are using if it's secondary data, eg. UK Biobank. How to get access within our department etc.
* If you're talking about scripts ensure you've commented in what order scripts should be run. Or even how to execute them in sequential order. 

#### Optional things we like:
* Maybe a sentence saying something like "If you find any errors, things that are unclear or have suggestions please contact XXX."
* A nice figure/diagram of the overview of your project or graphical abstract type figure. This is eye catching and nice to put as one of the first things on a README.
* Making a README at the start of a project, write an overview of what you plan to do and almost treat it like a checklist as you progress through the project. Ensuring you document each step as you go along. 

#### Other things to note:
* Before making your GitHub repo public share your repo with someone in the department and get them to take a look at your documentation to flag up anything that's not clear. 
* If you include "github_document" as the output file on an .Rmd file it will create a GitHub flavoured .md file that will render nicely.

* Online free software to make flow diagram type figures: https://www.diagrameditor.com/ These can be quite nice to give an overview of methods for your project.
* Example of READMEs on the departmental github (for access give Amelia your GitHub username to add you to the group).
