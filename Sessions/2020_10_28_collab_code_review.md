Collaboration is the essence and reason for using version control. In practice, collaboration in Git takes three main forms:

1. Collaborating with your past and future selves
2. Collaborating with yourself using different computers (e.g., laptop and cluster)
3. Collaborating with a colleague. 

Today we will focus on #3, but the skill you'll learn are also applicable to #1 and #2. We'll use a "buddy system" where you will collaborate with a coding partner, see what happens when you both try to commit changes to a file at the same time ("merge conflict"), and learn some effective ways to managing your work with a collaborator using git tools ("branches") and GitHub features ("pull requests").
