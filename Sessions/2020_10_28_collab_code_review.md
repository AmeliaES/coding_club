# KT Coding Club: Collaboration and Code Review

Collaboration is the essence and reason for using version control. In practice, collaboration in Git takes three main forms:

1. Collaborating with your past and future selves
2. Collaborating with yourself using different computers (e.g., laptop and cluster)
3. Collaborating with a colleague. 

Today we will focus on #3, but the skills you'll learn are also applicable to #1 and #2. We'll use a "buddy system" where you will collaborate with a coding partner, see what happens when you both try to commit changes to a file at the same time ("merge conflict"), and learn some effective ways to managing your work with a collaborator using git tools ("branches") and GitHub features ("pull requests").

We'll call our buddies "Buddy A" and "Buddy B".

## 1: Setting up a new repository

- **Buddy A**: Create a new repository.

- **Buddy A**: initialise the repository with a README or add it yourself. Clone the repository to your computer.
- **Buddy A**: grant read/write access on the repository to **Buddy B**. 
  - Go to *Settings* > *Manage Access* (you'll be prompted for your password)
    ![Repository settings](../markdown_images/github_settings.png)
  - Under *Manage Access* click the "Invite a collaborator" button
    ![Manage access](../markdown_images/github_manage_access.png)  
  - Enter Buddy B's **username** *(note that the field will suggest the names of all GitHub users)*

- **Buddy B**: Accept the invitation
  - Go to the page for the repository and clone the repository to your computer.
