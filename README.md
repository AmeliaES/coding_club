### Welcome to Coding Club!

#### About
In our department, many individuals encounter similar coding challenges eg. data cleaning/analysis and using high-performance computers. Addressing these challenges together not only makes them less daunting but also enhances efficiency by reducing duplicate efforts through shared code and resources. Additionally, good coding practices are crucial for reproducible science.

The coding clubâ€™s primary aim is to foster a friendly, supportive environment for improving coding skills together. We focus on creating and sharing resources that benefit both our research group and the wider research community (https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club).


**Please see:**
  * **[/Sessions](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/tree/main/Sessions) folder for materials and docs from coding club sessions.** 
  * **[Resources.md](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/blob/main/Resources.md) for a list of coding related resources.**

#### For people new to the Psychiatry department:
*  The [Psychiatry wiki](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/Psychiatry) is our main source of documentation. For anyone working on UK Biobank data a few of use collated a list of [FAQ's](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/ukb/blob/main/FAQ.md).

* Also see this [checklist for new starters](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl/coding_club/blob/main/Sessions/2021_01_27_new_starter_checklist.md) which gives an overview of what things need to be set up and where to go for help.
