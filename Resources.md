## Links to useful coding realted resources

### Documentation and Good Coding Practices:
* [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html)
  * Guide to reproducible data science. Really nice guide on code review, file naming conventions etc. Definitely a resource worth checking out.

* [How to make a good README file.](https://www.makeareadme.com/)

### Introductions to Git, Unix, Python, R:
* [Data](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) and [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) Carpentries:
  * [Edinburgh Carpentries](https://edcarp.github.io/)
  
### Using Notebooks:
* [A Tutorial about Analysis Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQtTrOcsfgk&list=PLfeZoWWKDNZBDJ3KNB1jLmilJo2ts2DMS&index=2&ab_channel=EdinburghMentalHealth)
  * Using R Markdown, Jupyter, making changes in github by Dr Mark Adams.
* Dr Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel's fantastic workshop on how to improve reproducibility in R (and extensive R Markdown explanation!)
  * [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA-vLsN-sic&feature=youtu.be) & [materials](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/improve-repro-workflow-reproducibilitea-2020/)

### Statistics & Coding:
* [Coding club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html) in Edinburgh by the ecology and environmental science department.
  * Made a set of tutorials to “replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn”.
